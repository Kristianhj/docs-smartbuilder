# SmartBuilder

{% hint style="info" %}
SmartBuilder is a level design tool which uses smart algorithms to find the assets you need based on the current selected context. i.e. if you select a pirate ship prefab, SmartBuilder will show you other ships, and other pirate related props. SmartBuilder is 100% plug and play - no setup required.

## How does this work?

Smartbuilder gives you a intutitive window with a list of context sensitive assets - i.e. if you are building a forest, it gives you a grid of vegetation prefabs and if you are building a Village it gives you a grid of houses. It will reflect your selection, and always show you the most relevant prefabs and allow you to drag directly into the scene. It does this by analyzing the filename, directory, tags and labels of your assets.
