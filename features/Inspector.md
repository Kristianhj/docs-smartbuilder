If you click any of the icons in the searchresult grid, you can also click the little question mark icon which opens up the Inspector area. This area has a number of available actions such as 'Replace Prefab' and 'Replace any prefab of selected type'.

If you donâ€™t want to have the 'Inspector area' open, you get access to the same actions by right clicking an icon in the grid.
