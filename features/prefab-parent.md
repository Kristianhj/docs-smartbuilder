SmartBuilder also includes an easy way to change the 'Default Prefab Parent'. Setting a Default Prefab Parent will make sure that all subsequent assets dragged into the scene will be children of the it. In the image above you can see that the current Default Prefab Parent is 'Shanty' but the yellow text 'Mansion' informs you that your current selection is a child of 'Mansion'. If you then click the button on the left SmartBuilder will then set the Default Prefab Parent to 'Mansion' â€“ easily allowing you to keep building with the prefabs in the correct structure.
